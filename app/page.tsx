<div> Answer 3 -Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day</div>
<div> My response - Manual responses for 50+ support emails arent scalable and consume significant time.

Although email (e.g., help@abc.com, support@abc.com) is convenient for customers, workflow automation tools like Zapier are vital. They automate ticket creation and provide auto-responses with case details. </div>

Moreover, Ill delve into Vercels SaaS platform architecture to understand its offerings better and ensure Im well-prepared to support Next.js applications on the Vercel platform. </div>
