      <div>Support tickets are goldmines for product improvement! By analyzing these tickets, we can identify recurring issues that impact user experience. This helps the product team:</div>
<div>Fix underlying architecture problems</div>
<div>Move towards scalable designs</div>
<div> This proactive approach minimizes user impact and strengthens the product overall. Support tickets also reveal customer pain points, allowing the product team to: </div>
<div> Focus on product robustness</div>
<div> Align future roadmaps with customer needs</div>
<div> By working together, support and product teams can deliver a superior customer experience, boosting satisfaction and loyalty. </div>

<div> Answer - Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders. </div>
<div> Support managers are key communicators during incidents. We collaborate with internal teams to keep everyone informed (customers, partners, leaders) with clear, timely updates. This transparency manages expectations, minimizes impact, and empowers customers to react (like initiating disaster recovery plans). .</div>
<div>Post-resolution, we provide a summary and initial cause analysis. Once the full investigation concludes, we share the final report with customers and explain the post-incident review outcome. This builds trust and ensures everyone learns from the experience, preventing future occurrences.</div>
