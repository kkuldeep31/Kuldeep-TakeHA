===============================

<div>Question No 2</div>

<div> Question - What do you want to learn or do more of at work? </div>
<div>My Answer</div>
<div> When it comes to learning, Ill thoroughly explore Next.js functionalities and its unique features compared to React.js. Moreover, Ill delve into Vercels SaaS platform architecture to understand its offerings better and ensure Im well-prepared to support Next.js applications on the Vercel platform. </div>

<div> To continue with the learning, I would start by immersing myself in the product, services, and team dynamics. This approach would help me to learn and build strong relationships with both the people/team and product/technology. </div>

<div>My existing technical background and eagerness to learn will help to quickly grasp the product and processes with a lesser learning curve. This would set the stage for me to start contributing meaningfully. </div>

<div> A deep understanding of the product empowers me to see things from the customers perspective. This lets me identify how theyre using it, where they might be facing challenges, and how we can help them maximize product usage to solve their problems. </div>

<div> In tandem with mastering the technical aspects, Ill also delve into the customer support operations side. Heres my plan</div>

<div>1.Ill map the existing data landscape utilized by the support team. Leveraging these data points for analysis will provide valuable insights to enhance customer support. This will help me to quickly start taking Data driven decisions. </div>
<div>2.By leveraging data and team experience, Ill develop a data-driven action plan to address key areas for improvement. This plan will focus on: </div>
<div>3.Identifying opportunities to streamline workflows, reduce dependencies, and enhance technical capabilities within the support team. </div>
<div>4.Analyzing data to pinpoint areas that need improvements. </div>
<div>5.To minimize Internal Dependencies I would start assessing reliance on other teams and exploring options for greater self-sufficiency within the support team, potentially through knowledge-sharing or cross-training initiatives. </div>
<div>6.Evaluating processes for automation opportunities to reduce manual tasks and expedite turnaround times. </div>
<div>7.Identifying common customer issues that could be addressed through improved self-service resources (e.g., knowledge base articles, FAQs, troubleshooting guides). </div>
<div>8.Identifying and addressing any gaps in existing documentation to ensure clarity, completeness, and accessibility for both customers and support staff. </div>
<div> ========================================</div>

<div>Question no 3</div>
<div>My Answer</div>

<div> Describe how you solved a challenge or technical issue that you faced in a previous role (preferably in a previous support role). How did you determine that your solution was successful? </div>

<div> I encountered a significant challenge that encompassed both technical and operational aspects. A highly escalated customer reported a critical issue with a data pipeline, impacting various downstream applications crucial for business insights, including ETL processes, databases, and visualization tools like PowerBI and Tableau. </div>
<div> The data pipeline handled processed data, with its processing logic in Spark on the Databricks platform. However, a prerequisite program on another server, managed by third-party software, complicates matters. </div>
<div> Operationally, the customer inadvertently raised duplicate cases, resulting in negative feedback from their leadership despite our clarification that the issue lay with the third-party vendor. In response, I, as the duty manager, engaged with the customer directly, despite the unavailability of the assigned engineer due to personal reasons. </div>
<div> While being on a Customer call, In parallel, I coordinated with another engineer to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Leveraging the customers operational access to their server, we swiftly identified a Linux file permission issue in a directory, directly related to the third-party software. Despite not being responsible for that third party server instance maintenance, we provided technical recommendations, including chmod and chown commands in Linux. </div>
<div> The customer was the server/instance owner and had permission from their leadership to carry out our recommendations (by following their emergency change process). </div>
<div> Implementing our suggestions promptly resolved the issue, earning positive feedback from the customer and reversing the negative CSAT rating. This successful resolution underscored our commitment to customer satisfaction and willingness to collaborate, ultimately restoring trust and confidence in our support services. </div>

<div> During our call, the Customer ascertained and confirmed that their BI applications are getting the new updated data. </div> 

<div> ==============================================</div>
<div> Question no 4</div>
 
<div> When would you choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel? </div>

<div> My Answer</div>
<div> I would consider using the below functions based on the use cases: </div>

<div> Edge functions -  If the web app is designated with a task requiring low latency and needs to process data closer to the end users location, then using Edge functions will help. If low latency and geographically distributed processing are critical, prioritize edge functions. Also, consider for real-time interactions or immediate responses, consider edge functions</div>

<div> Some of the use cases </div>
<div>1.High-quality and quantity images or content that needs optimization for faster delivery. </div>
<div>2.Personalization based on user data (Content personalization) </div>
<div>3.Authentication or Authorization checks</div>
<div>4.Headers modification or cookies based on user location. </div>
<div> ------------------------------------------</div>

<div> Serverless Functions: Serverless functions are suited for the below use cases that do not require real-time processing or direct user interactions. Even asynchronuous workload works well with serverless functions. </div>

<div> 1.Ideal for use cases that involve the execution of backend logic, like analytic intensive workload, Dynamic data processing, High volume of Data Manipulations, compute intensive workloads, Apps requiring connections with API endpoints, Form submissions </div>
<div> ------------------------------------------</div>
<div> Edge Middleware: 1. When the application needs to manipulate requests or response customization before reaching serverless functions, then edge middleware would be the better choice. </div>
<div> 2.Frequently accessed data caching to get faster response time. </div>
<div> 3.Specific pattern-based URL rewrite or routing to a particular application or web page. </div>
<div> 4.Rate throttling/Limiting or adding security headers</div>

<div>=======================================================</div>

<div> Question No 5</div>

<div> Question - Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that youve not seen before. How would you begin troubleshooting this and what questions would you ask the customer to understand the situation better? </div>

<div> My approach would be as follows. </div>

<div> Firstly, I express gratitude to the customer for reaching out to support and promptly acknowledge the reported issue. Assuring the customer with confidence, I commit to providing all possible assistance to resolve the build issue effectively. </div>

<div> Concurrently, while awaiting the requested details from the customer, I initiate the process of gathering the necessary information. This includes acquiring framework specifics, complete error message logs, platform details, and a screenshot of the error message. I will ask about the development environment, and any recent changes made, and aim to reproduce the issue in our lab environment for further analysis. </div>
<div> In parallel, I conduct thorough online research by searching for the framework name, build issue keywords, and the exact error message. Exploring official documentation, community forums, and company resources, and utilizing tools like Glean search, I aim to identify relevant solutions or workarounds. Additionally, I leverage internal communication channels such as Slack and seek assistance from subject matter experts. </div>
<div> Throughout the process, I maintain transparent communication with the customer, updating them on my progress and efforts. Despite the framework being new to me, I actively seek solutions and share relevant findings, including potential workaround steps, for the customers consideration. </div>

<div> ==============================================</div>
<div> Question No 6</div>

<div> Question - However Customer is not happy about the progress and reverts as below. </div>
<div>---------------</div>
<div> Im so frustrated. Ive been trying to make this work for hours and I just cant figure it
out. It must be a platform issue so just fix it for me instead of asking me questions. </div>
<div>----------------</div>
<div> Answer - My response would be as follows. </div>

<div> I completely understand your frustration and the stress that comes with spending hours trying to resolve this issue. Please know that I empathize with your situation, and Im committed to helping you find a solution as quickly as possible. </div>

<div> Question No 7</div>
<div> A customer writes into the Helpdesk asking How do I do a redirect from the /blog
path to https://example.com Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any
information about your decision making process after the reply. </div>

<div> Pls note - Assuming that Customer is using Apache or Tomcat. I will be using both as examples. </div>

<div> My response</div>
<div> Subject: Re: Redirecting /blog path to example.com</div>

<div> Hi CustomerName, </div>

<div> Thanks for reaching out to Vercel support. My name is (My Name) and I will be assisting you with this ticket. </div>

<div> To set up a redirect from /blog path to example.com you can utilize the below methods depending on the web server configuration and setup. </div>

<div> Considering security aspects in mind, we would highly recommend using a server-side redirect. The reason is that it is the most reliable and secure way to implement a redirect. </div>

<div> Please note that the below examples assume a basic server config. In Apache servers, one common and recommended method is to use a web server config file such as (.htaccess) to create the redirect rule. </div>

<div> -------------------------</div>
<div> RewriteEngine On</div>
<div> RewriteRule blog example.com (R=302,L) </div>
<div> --------------------------</div>
<div> This would need Apache restart so that the configuration is picked up. </div>

<div> If tomcat is the web server </div>
<div> This method involves editing your tomcat applications context.xml file. Within the (Context) element, you can add a valve element configured for redirection</div>

<div> Take a backup of context.xml (In Linux, cp context.xml /backup/tomcat_context.bck.xml) </div>
<div>  Open context.xml in any text editor (vi) </div>

<div> ----------------------------</div>

<div> Restart tomcat</div>

<div> Once implemented, thoroughly test your redirects to ensure they work as expected. </div>
<div> ----------------------------</div>
<div> Pls note - I would send the context.xml code snippet along with redirect rules for customers familiarity.</div>
<div> I removed the sample context.xml redirect rule below as it was interfering with this typescript program </div>
<div> --------------------------</div>
<div> Syntax Explanation - </div>

<div> pattern=/blog(.*) This matches any request starting with /blog, capturing anything that follows as a group (.*).</div>
<div> replacement=example.com - This defines the target URL for the redirection. </div>
<div> redirect=true This specifies a permanent (301) redirect. </div>
<div> --------------------------</div>

<div> Additional details </div>
<div> Compared to client-side redirects, the reason we highly recommend using server-side redirects is for the below reasons</div>
<div>1.It ensures all users are redirected, regardless of their browser or device</div>
<div>2.Server-side redirects happen before any content is loaded, potentially improving website security.</div>
<div>3.Server-side redirects are generally faster than client-side redirects</div>

<div>301 vs. 302 Redirect: When implementing a server-side redirect, youll need to choose between a 301 (permanent) or 302 (temporary) redirect. A 301 redirect is the best choice in this case, as it informs search engines that the /blog path has permanently moved. (in context.xml - redirect=true: This specifies a permanent 301 redirect.) </div>
<div>If you have existing links pointing to specific blog posts under the blog path, you may need to update them to point directly to the new location on your main domain. </div>

<div>Hope that with the above information, you should be able to accomplish the desired result. If in case of any further assistance needed, please do not hesitate to reach out to us and we will be happy to help. </div>

<div> Question No 8 </div>

<div> Question - A customer is creating a site and would like their project not to be indexed by search engines. Please write a reply to the customer. Feel free to add any information about your decision making process after the reply. </div>

<div> My answer </div>
<div> Hi CustomerName, </div>

<div> Thanks for reaching out to Vercel support. My name is (My Name) and I will be assisting you with this ticket. </div>

<div> After reviewing your ask, we see that there are a couple of ways to prevent search engines from indexing your website. </div>

<div> Using Robots.txt </div>
<div> The go-to method is creating a robots.txt file. Placed at the root of your website, this file acts like a guide for search engine crawlers, telling them which pages are off-limits for indexing. A simple example would be a line disallowing all indexing as exampled below. </div>
<div> -------------------------</div>
<div> User-agent: *</div>
<div> Disallow: /</div>
<div> --------------------------</div>
<div> For more granular control, consider meta robots tags. Placed within the (head) section of individual website HTML code, these tags offer specific indexing instructions for those pages. In contrast, robots.txt works at a broader website level. </div>

<div> The below example of a meta robots tag instructs search engines not to index the page </div>

<div> -----------------------</div>

<div>  name robots content noindex </div>
<div> ------------------------</div>

<div> Robots.txt is generally preferred for simplicity when you want to prevent indexing of your entire website. </div>
<div> Meta robots tags are useful for selectively preventing indexing of specific pages while allowing others to be indexed. </div>


<div> We assume that your website is still in the development phase and hence you do not want to get the website indexed. </div>

<div> However the above instructions are not foolproof and do not guarantee that the search engines wont try to crawl your site for indexing purposes. This primarily instructs search engines on how to handle your website. </div>

<div> Once the website is ready for production launch, you may need to consider removing these restrictions so that the search engines index your content</div>

<div> Additionally we would also like to suggest using password-protecting your website if you desire to add an extra layer of security until you are ready for public launch. </div>

<div>Hope the above-provided solutions are sufficient to accomplish your desired outcome. If you have any further questions or need help implementing these solutions, please contact us. Thank you. </div>

<div>Best regards, </div>
